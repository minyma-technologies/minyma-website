# Fund Structure

Our fund consists of multiple approaches ranging from standard long-term investments to highly optimized algorithmic white box systems. We have a preferred blend of these strategies that we present on this site in detail. However, our clients have the freedom to choose a profile based on their risk appetite. Further details can be found in the **Customization** section.

A key differentiator of our technology is that it consists of data-science, and probability theory-based market-neutral algorithms over direct investments into specific assets. The goal of these strategies is to exploit the market's volatility by custom developed quantitative tools. To reduce risk and exposure to unfortunate market movements we developed these formulas  so that they are uncorrelated in the long run.
