# Our Research Process

At Minyma Technologies we focus on creating algorithmic pipelines that automatically explore inefficiencies in the financial markets by finding local minimums in a multi-dimensional parameterized hyperspace and by selecting clusters of algorithms in multiple positions, thus resulting in an aggregate low-risk algorithmic portfolio. We dedicate special emphasis on accurate simulations, execution and on avoiding overfitting.
