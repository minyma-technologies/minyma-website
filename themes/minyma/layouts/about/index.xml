      <description>Fund Structure Our fund consists of two investment categories each having their own strategies and approaches.
The first one is a portfolio of well-diversified and uncorrelated trading algorithms which ensure the possibility of achieving exceptional returns compared to standard hedge funds and investment firms.
The second category of our fund follows traditional investing methodologies. These long-term investments act as a hedging tool for the potential short-term losses of our algorithms.</description>
