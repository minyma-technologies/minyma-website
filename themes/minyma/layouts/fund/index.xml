      <description>Producing exceptional results comes with a price in scalability. Our returns are achieved by trading on highly volatile markets like commodities, crypto currencies, and forex. We have an upper limit in the billion-dollar domain where the fund can no longer perform so well, but as of now the Minyma Fund is a great opportunity for a high profit investment.</description>

      <description>Fund Structure Our fund consists of two investment categories each having their own strategies and approaches.
The first one is a portfolio of well-diversified and uncorrelated trading algorithms which ensure the possibility of achieving exceptional returns compared to standard hedge funds and investment firms.
The second category of our fund follows traditional investing methodologies. These long-term investments act as a hedging tool for the potential short-term losses of our algorithms.</description>

      <description>We plan on charging a 2% flat fee plus a dynamic performance fee. Our dynamic fee means that we charge our clients based on how well we performed. The sole purpose of this fee structure is that we don’t have high costs if we fail to overperform the market.
